I have setup this repo to use GitHub actions to deploy to PyPI.org.
When I am happy with a feature or whatever, I need to:
1. Make sure that changes are in the main branch.
2. Go to Actions and run the Upload Python Package workflow.

Someday, I will make this automated. But there are too many outdated
tutorials for me to bother setting this up.
